"""
Basic syntax and import test for Python RADIUS server.

This test script verifies that all required dependencies are properly installed
and that the custom RADIUS server modules can be imported successfully. It's
designed to catch configuration issues early before attempting to run the
full RADIUS server.

Purpose:
    - Verify all Python dependencies are installed (mysql-connector, pyrad, dotenv)
    - Test that custom RADIUS server modules can be imported
    - Validate basic DatabaseManager functionality
    - Ensure the development environment is properly configured

Usage:
    python3 test/test_syntax.py

For beginners:
    This is like a "health check" for the software - it makes sure all the
    pieces are in place before trying to run the main program. Think of it
    like checking that you have all ingredients before starting to cook.

Exit codes:
    0 - All tests passed
    1 - Some tests failed
